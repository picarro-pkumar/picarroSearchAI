CRDS is indeed the core technology behind Picarro's analyzers, providing unprecedented precision and stability in gas concentration measurements.\n\nAs described in our resources, CRDS works by injecting light from a laser into a high-finesse optical cavity. The cavity contains mirrors with reflectivity > 99.99%, allowing light to bounce back and forth thousands of times, creating a long effective path length. When the laser is turned off, the light intensity decays exponentially, and the decay time (ring-down time) is measured with high precision.\n\nThe presence of target gases in the cavity absorbs light at specific wavelengths, shortening the ring-down time. Concentration is then calculated from the change in ring-down time. This technology offers several advantages, including:\n\n* Superior stability: No baseline drift over months\n* High sensitivity: Parts-per-trillion detection limits possible\n* Absolute measurements: No calibration gases required\n* Wide dynamic range: 6+ orders of magnitude\n* Fast response: Sub-second measurements\n* Rugged design: Works in harsh environments\n\nPicarro's patented CRDS technology has revolutionized atmospheric monitoring and enabled new scientific discoveries in climate research, air quality assessment, and industrial process control.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the concept of CRDS and its applications with Picarro!",
